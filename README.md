# CRIMSy
_Cloud Resource & Information Managment System_

CRIMSy is the software which powers the **Leibniz Bioactives Cloud** and which will power the research network **Autonomy in Old Age**. Our goal is to provide a distributed research platform for the exchange and analysis of data. A second objective is to enable users to choose, whom they want to share their data with and to provide them with fine grained access control across institutional borders. Finally, we want to address the specific needs of scientists dealing with chemical structures, sequence information and other biochemical data. We're currently in transition from our in house repository to GitHub.
