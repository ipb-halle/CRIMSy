# CRIMSy
_Cloud Resource & Information Managment System_

CRIMSy is the software which powers the **Leibniz Bioactives Cloud** and which will power the research network **Autonomy in Old Age**. Our goal is to provide a distributed research platform for the exchange and analysis of data. A second objective is to enable users to choose, whom they want to share their data with and to provide them with fine grained access control across institutional borders. Finally, we want to address the specific needs of scientists dealing with chemical structures, sequence information and other biochemical data. 

Additional information is available on the website of the Leibniz Research Alliance "Bioactive Compounds and Biotechnology": [https://www.leibniz-wirkstoffe.de/projects/lbac_project/](https://www.leibniz-wirkstoffe.de/projects/lbac_project/). 

We took part in the Hackathon EUvsVirus Hackathon 2020.The homepage of the project can be found at:

## Funding
The [Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry (IPB)](https://www.ipb-halle.de/) in Halle (Saale), Germany, has been supporting this project with a software developer position and finances most of the infrastructure required for software development.

The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the state Saxony-Anhalt have been supporting the development of the "Cloud Resource and Information Management System" since 2019 as part of the project ["ProCognito - Pflanzliche Wirkstoffe zum Erhalt der kognitiven Leistungsf√§higkeit im Alter"](http://www.aia.ovgu.de/Projekte/F%C3%B6rderperiode+2_3/K%C3%B6rper+und+Alter%28n%29.html) (ZS/2018/11/95581), which is part of the research network ["Autonomy in Old Age"](http://autonomie-im-alter.ovgu.de/en/).

The project was initiated in 2016 as "Leibniz Bioactives Cloud" by the [Leibniz Research Alliance "Bioactive Compounds and Biotechnology"](https://www.leibniz-wirkstoffe.de/) and was supported until 2020 with funds from the Senate Strategic Committee (SAS) of the Leibniz Association.
