# Note:
# -----
# This template illustrates, how the CRIMSy Agency could be used 
# to process different types of jobs (e.g. PRINT jobs, COMPUTE jobs, 
# etc.). The script will receive the JOB TYPE as first argument,
# the QUEUE as second argument, JOB ID as third argument and input 
# data on STDIN. Results are expected via STDOUT. 
#
# Administrators are expected to modify and extend this script to 
# their needs. The script is not intended for manual calling although
# it is possible, e.g. for debugging purposes.
